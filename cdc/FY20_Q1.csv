I've read the CDC's recent advisories regarding the anticipated AFM/AFP season that curiously coincides with the August-October time-frame of when students typically receive their school vaccinations and boosters, including OPV and MMR. In the advisories, however, the CDC does not acknowledge the potential link between AFM/AFP. Going back to the early 2000, AFP has been linked to the oral polio vaccine in India. However, communications and advisories on AFM in the US insist the disease cannot be linked to vaccination as the deterioration in the myelin sheath sometimes occurs up to 2 years past typical routine vaccinations (between ages of 7-9). Previously a link was made with AFP, but now currently AFM is dismissed as being potentially linked to vaccination. Therefore, I would like to request information regarding potential links between Acute Flaccid Myelitis and the CDC's recommended vaccination schedule or one or all of the vaccines, including the cumulative effects. Specifically, I would like to know if CDC staff or researchers have questioned or studied in length, or has plans to study, whether vaccines or the cumulative effects of the vaccination schedule may be linked to the development or onset of acute flaccid myelitis including years after vaccination. If it has not been studied, why not? Are there plans to study and compare the rates of AFM among vaccinated versus unvaccinated children? If AFP in children was linked to vaccination in other countries, who made the decision to conclude vaccinations are not linked to it? I would like to know how the CDC came up with that conclusion and why they are calling it AFM and not AFP? I checked the resources online, but could not find answers to my question.",

There were 143,273 deaths from COVID-19. Then there was breakdown by age, ethnicity, gender, and more. Please consider this letter an FoIA request looking for the following information: 1. Of the COVID-19 *deaths* reported, how many were from COVID as the *primary* diagnosis? (You go to the doctor or hospital not feeling well, and otherwise healthy, you are not sure what is wrong. Tests are run and you find you have COVID-19.) 2. How many COVID-19 deaths were from a *secondary* diagnosis? (A person goes to a doctor or the hospital with some apparently unrelated ailment or injury, contracts COVID while they are there, or perhaps a person in a nursing home who is regularly battling some ailment due to age.) 3. And the most important question of all, what does the CDC rely on for its information? In other words, do the doctors and hospitals report to the insurance companies, then the insurance companies report to the state, and the state to the CDC, or is there some other “chain of information” the CDC follows regarding U07.1 (ICD-10 code).
