Description of Requested Records: All studies and/or reports in the possession, custody or control of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and/or the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) describing the purification of the alleged “COVID-19 virus” (aka “SARS-COV-2”, including any alleged “variants”) directly from a sample taken from a diseased human, where the patient sample was not first combined with any other source of genetic material (i.e. monkey kidney cells aka Vero cells; fetal bovine serum). Clarification of Request: Please note that I am not requesting studies/reports where researchers failed to purify the suspected “virus” and instead: cultured something, and/or performed an amplification test (i.e. PCR), and/or fabricated a genome from sequences (allegedly) detected in an impure substance, and/or produced electron microscopy images of unpurified things. I am already aware that according to virus theory a “virus” requires host cells in order to replicate, and am not requesting records that describe replication of a ‘virus’ without host cells. Nor am I requesting records that describe a strict fulfillment of Koch’s Postulates, or records where researchers conflate extraction of genetic material from a patient sample or cell culture with “virus isolation”, or records that describe a suspected “virus” floating in a vacuum, or private patient information. I simply request records that describe purification (separation of the alleged virus from everything else in the patient sample, as per standard laboratory practices for the purification of other very small things). Please note that my request includes any study/report matching the above description, authored by anyone, anywhere. If any records match the above description of requested records and are currently available in the public domain, please provide enough information about each record so that I may identify and access each one with certainty (i.e. title, author(s), date, journal, where the public may access it). Please provide URLs where possible. Format: Pdf documents sent to me via email; I do not wish for anything to be shipped to me.
