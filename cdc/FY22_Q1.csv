How come you want to force a vaccine on us, yet if we get any sort of life-altering side effect, we can’t sue you? Are you not forcing it on us to save yourself? Did the Delta-8 variant originate from the vaccine? I find it extremely odd that it pops up after the vaccine & vaccinated people aren’t immune to it. Why are you trying to force vaccines on people who don’t want them, if those that want them are protected? How come there are “mask mandates” but unvaxxed people aren’t allowed in events by simply wearing a mask? Do masks not work at public events? Only in restaurants walkways? Oh, because once you get to your table COVID can’t get you! Right? Please show me the proof that vaccinations are indeed 100% safe, proven productive with no alternative solution.

Surely, the governor and/or his agents must have this information. I cannot see Governor Charles Baker signing EUAs (Emergency Use Authorizations) or implementing contact tracing, curfews, testing requirements, or mask mandates without having proof that a virus (or a variant of said virus) exists. As per 950 CMR 32 (2), if any fees are assessed for these records, please provide an itemized estimate of these fees and wait for my approval before proceeding with the records request. However, I agree in advance to pay up to $75 for the records request, and no approval is needed for fees less than $75. Granting a fee waiver would greatly benefit the community, as disclosure of these records is clearly in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

22-00533-FOIA,"Kearney, Diana",Oxfam America,"Re: Public Information Act Request to CDC To Whom It May Concern: Oxfam America and Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (“Oxfam” and “RAICES”) submit this Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request (“Request”) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC” or the “Agency”). The Requesters seek records relating to the plan to provide COVID-19 vaccines to migrants detained in U.S. custody, and the ultimate rejection of said plan. The Request is made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552, 5 U.S.C. § 552 et seq., and CDC regulations. BACKGROUND The U.S. government maintains detention centers for migrants throughout the United States. Recognizing the extraordinary circumstances of COVID-19 and its major risk of spreading throughout institutionalized settings, the CDC issues guidance for detention centers for preventing and managing the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure the safety of detained individuals, staff, contractors, and visitors to detention centers. Previously, Biden administration officials created a plan to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to migrants held in the custody or control of the U.S. government. However, on November 8, 2021, the Washington Post revealed that Biden administration officials changed its position to implement a vaccination plan. As of the writing of this Request, the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. continue to grow with each new variant and there still is no uniform vaccination plan in place for detained migrants. However, as the administration’s own Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci confirmed, migrants are “absolutely not” driving the COVID-19 surge. To that end, Oxfam and RAICES seek disclosure of any and all responsive records, including all electronic documents and communications in the custody of CDC relating to this issue, as described in the specific requests and instructions below. REQUESTERS Oxfam America is a non-profit development agency dedicated to developing lasting solutions to poverty and social injustice. A centerpiece of this work involves supporting the world’s most vulnerable communities, including refugees and other forcibly displaced populations. Oxfam supports displaced communities by tackling the drivers of migration, providing emergency humanitarian aid to those fleeing persecution, and advocating that governments respect the human rights of migrants. RAICES, a non-profit legal services agency based in San Antonio, Texas, defends the rights of immigrants and refugees, empowers individuals, families, and communities, and advocates for their liberty and justice. With legal services, social programs, and an advocacy team focused on changing the narrative around immigration in this country, RAICES provides legal services and counsel in various immigrant detention facilities throughout the state of Texas and has continued to do so throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. DEFINITIONS Plan: The term “plan” as used in the Request relates to the COVID-19 vaccination program revealed in the Washington Post article. Records: The term “records” as used in the Request includes all records preserved in electronic or written form, including but not limited to: e-mails; text communications between phones or other electronic devices (including but not limited to, communications sent via SMS or other text, Blackberry Messenger, iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, G-chat, or Twitter direct message); images, video, and audio recorded on cell phones; voicemail messages; social-media posts; formal and informal presentations; alerts; bulletins; advisories; post-it notes, and agendas, minutes or notes of meetings and phone calls. Please note: Should any responsive record contain personally identifying information of any third party",
