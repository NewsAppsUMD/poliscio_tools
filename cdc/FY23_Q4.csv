Fee Waiver: Yes Max Fees: $30 Fee Waiver Submission: I request that you waive all applicable fees associated with this request. Under 5 U.S.C(a)(4)(iii), “Documents shall be furnished without charge…if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. “ Disclosure in this case meets the statutory criteria, as the records sought to detail the operations and the activities of the government. The public interest in this significant expansion of public understanding of government operations far outweighs any commercial interest of my own in the requested release. If I am not granted a complete fee waiver, I request to be considered a member of the news media for fee purposes. I am willing to pay all reasonable expenses incurred in the process of the FOIA request. My previous journalistic work has been featured in Muckrock, the Centcom press portal, local publications, among others. This request is primarily and fundamentally for non-commercial purposes, and will be used to publish investigative journalism for information in the public interest through multiple news media brands, including the Daily Signal.

If there will be another ACIP meeting prior to approval, has it been scheduled, or have dates been proposed?

This does not specifically occur anywhere in public CDC materials. The issue of droplet spread of airborne diseases is at the very center of current controversy in public policy, because it's at the core of an ongoing worldwide scientific paradigm shift in the field of infectious diseases and bioaerosols. I am seeking, in the general sense, copies of discussions, emails, and records, mostly external, but also internal deliberations, regarding this article. In the specific sense, in addition to the aforementioned records, I am seeking the discussions with reporters that contain the phrase and/or typographical variations of the phrase ""The virus is primarily spread via respiratory droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, or through direct contact with a contaminated surface"", but also, any documents/records that are used to support that claim, and any related discussions of formulating that claim as presented to the press. Given this primarily involves copies of direct correspondence with members of the public, I do not expect complete redactions under the deliberative process principle. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 20 business days, as the statute requires. Sincerely, ALEXANDER RICCIO Upload documents directly: (b)(6)"
