It is no coincidence that the cancer rates within the ‘cancer alley’ have been so much higher than anywhere else since 1989. There are 150 petrochemical plants and refineries along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Although studies have been made connecting chloroprene emissions and its potential to cause cancer, the only way of truly knowing how deadly these plants are is to view the cancer reports in the dozen parishes located in ‘cancer alley.’ As a resident of Louisiana currently living in Baton Rouge, I feel it is my right to know the cancer reports of the indicated parishes to compare the rates to other parishes. Through the toxic substances and disease registry (ATSDR), I can retrieve answers to how deadly these toxins are that are being released in concentrated amounts along the Mississippi River.

In the absence of evidence that masks are safe for children, I cannot consent to mask my children for 1/3 of their day, 5 days a week as I need to ensure my children will not be harmed from prolonged wear of these masks. Without scientific evidence that there are no adverse effects to children physically, mentally, socially, developmentally and academically from wearing masks for prolonged, extended periods of time, I am left to assume the risk of harm to my child with no evidence of any direct benefit. Children wearing face masks throughout the school day equates to 6+ hours and with masks required on the bus as well that’s an additional hour per day (~30 min to and from school). This amount of wear by children is comparable to occupational exposure where OSHA regulations would set specific standards for wear and children would be fitted for face masks appropriately (in addition to being properly trained on how to wear, don and doff, store and sanitize when soiled). Face masks are PPE, classified as either an occupational protective device or a medical device. Since neither form is FDA approved for children, this is, in essence, an experiment and as with any experiment there may be risk associated with participation, and because of this risk, informed consent is always a requirement as is the ability to not participate or terminate participation without penalty. Since my children are entitled to a K-12 education they are forced against their consent and mine to wear a face mask or to receive a separate, unequal education in the form of worksheets self instructed at home while their peers learn from certified teachers in person in school. Children should not be discriminated on the basis of refusal to wear an untested unapproved medical device.

Lastly, I am interested in knowing how much money was allocated for the process of generating these official documents related to circumcision, including the literature review, meetings, and all other matters related to the project.

In relation to each item, please include any attachments or supporting documents. If communications cannot be released due to privacy or privilege, then please release all non-excludable data and meta-data.

Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media.

Atlanta, GA 30333 Re: FOIA Request - CDC funding for Baby-Friendly and other exclusive breastfeeding promotion Dear Mr. Andoh: Under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. Section 552), I am requesting documents and data concerning CDC funding relating to current or prospective Baby-Friendly (“BF”) or BF-style hospitals/healthcare facilities, breastfeeding programs, and other exclusive breastfeeding promotion. This request seeks to make public information on the full picture of CDC funding for breastfeeding promotion as it is currently usually understood. That is, the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding from birth up to the first 4-6 months of a child’s life with no formula or other food or drink supplementation. This request includes documents and data relating to the following: - CDC funding of BF or BF-style hospitals/healthcare facilities, breastfeeding programs, and other exclusive breastfeeding promotion, such as grants to hospitals to promote breastfeeding. Insofar as this part of this request might duplicate part of a concurrently submitted FOIA request, it is only necessary to disclose relevant records once in your response. - CDC funding of BF itself including but limited to CDC contracts and grants. - CDC funding of other exclusive breastfeeding promotion organisations and programs in hospitals and other healthcare facilities, including but not limited to government contracts and grants, including but not limited to the Best Fed Beginnings initiative. - CDC funding of other exclusive breastfeeding promotion organisations and programs outside hospital settings (e.g., in social service and prenatal education program contexts), including but not limited to government contracts and grants. In relation to each item, please include any attachments or supporting documents. As a representative of the news media (a freelance writer previously published with outlets including *The Guardian* and *Christian Science Monitor* — see https://verawil.de/publications/ ) and new mom researching a book on breastfeeding, I am gathering information on preventable harms to newborns from BF-style exclusive breastfeeding promotion. This information is of current interest to the public because published medical studies dating back in some cases decades indicate rising incidences of preventable newborn rehospitalizations due to dehydration and starvation when breastfeeding does not work well enough and formula supplementation is not offered. These rising rates of phenomena like jaundice and hypernatremia can cause permanent brain damage and even death in previously healthy newborns. There have been numerous recent mainstream news stories on the work of the Fed Is Best Foundation, a U.S. non-profit organisation started in 2016 to raise awareness, educate, and help prevent these harms. But in spite of sufficient medical evidence according to experts, and vocal advocacy efforts including from moms of affected babies, BF and BF-style exclusive breastfeeding promotion policies and practices continue to be widespread and in some cases still growing. To the extent that this may be due to CDC support of BF and similar forms of exclusive breastfeeding promotion, there is a public interest in better understanding that support. Please take note of the Office of Management and Budget guidelines published March 27, 1987 (52 FR 10012) that include electronic publications and other nontraditional publishers as representatives of the news media. OMB guidelines say that past publication can be used as proof I am a media representative. Please also remember that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has determined that even a"

This request includes documents and data relating to the following: - CDC monetary support of BF, including grants (e.g., Preventive Health and Health Services (PHHS) Block Grants) to hospitals and other healthcare facilities to certify as Baby-Friendly; - CDC non-monetary support of BF; - CDC influence over BF’s management and personnel; - CDC influence over BF’s interpretation and implementation of its goals of exclusive breastfeeding promotion; and - Communications between CDC and BF as they might show BF effectively fulfilling public functions in terms of supporting stated U.S. public health policy goals relating to breastfeeding. In relation to each item, please include any attachments or supporting documents. If communications cannot be released due to privacy or privilege, then please release all non-excludable data and meta-data.
