I tried to use keyboards below to be as specific as possible, but it is my intent to seek records from the Director of the CDC and the relating to the discussion on the legality of issuing a national stay-at-home order or quarantine. 1) I am requesting all available memos from the Director of the CDC ""Robert R. Redfield"" created from December 1, 2019 through April 11, 2020 relating to the discussion of the legality of a ""national quarantine"", ""nationwide quarantine"", ""nationwide stay-at-home order"", ""stay-at-home order"", or a ""federal quarantine"". 2) I am requesting all documents from the CDC that are allowed to be requested under the FOIA created from December 1, 2019 through April 11, 2020 relating to the discussion of the legality of a ""national quarantine"", ""nationwide quarantine"", ""nationwide stay-at-home order"", ""stay-at-home order"", or a ""federal quarantine"". I am requesting for a waiver of a fee for this FOIA Request because I believe that it is in the best interest of the public that it should not cost money to receive internal documents that could result in a national order that could affect us all. If this waiver is not possible, I am willing to pay a maximum of $30. Please let me know if there will be a fee and if it will be higher than $30. I am also requesting that this request be expedited as COVID-19 is currently impacting the United States and a national quarantine order could be authorized at any time. I believe that before an order is authorized, we should be able to review the facts and reasoning to believe that a national stay-at-home order is legal. If any request is too broad or unclear, please respond back and I will clarify it and/or limit the scope of this FOIA Request.

This is lower than most estimates I’ve seen in peer-reviewed studies, and it’s certainly lower than the CFR for New York City, so I’m seeking to find how CDC came up with this estimate. In particular, CDC’s estimate is being weaponized by activists opposed to all non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 to claim that COVID-19 is minimally more serious than the flu. Alex Berenson just published a short book, which prominently cites the CDC estimate, in his quest to discredit the need to employ non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19. His book is a best-seller in Amazon’s Book store and Kindle Store (top 5, currently). You can read a free excerpt here in which the CDC estimate is cited: http://www.alexberenson.com/the-first-1000-words-of-chapter-1-of-unreported-truths-about-covid-19-and-lockdowns-the-booklet-amazon-has-censored/ Hence, I request that CDC urgently disclose how it arrived at a CFR of 0.4% (implying an infection fatality ratio below 0.3%).

My request is for almost exactly the same dataset as is posted publicly online of the weekly provisional counts of deaths from any cause by age for the United States and by state: https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Weekly-counts-of-deaths-by-jurisdiction-and-age-gr/y5bj-9g5w/ This dataset is frequently updated on the CDC’s website; my request is for this same data, but instead of age breakdowns, it would include breakdowns by race/hispanic origin. Note that this request is a follow up to a previous such request, where the program directed me to data that I could use to extract monthly such counts. However that data is only updated until the end of 2018, and I require more recent data in order to capture the time period of the COVID-19 virus. The response also suggested I contact the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC), but indicated that this office is currently closed due to the pandemic, so this would not be feasible; additionally, since I am only requesting aggregate counts, it should not be necessary to make a research proposal to the RDC for restricted-use records of that kind. Therefore I’d like to ask for consideration of the fact that while the department’s previous response was approaching the data from my original request, it was ultimately not usable to me. Given this delay, I ask that the program give my current request attention as immediately as possible. As noted above, the data I’m seeking is very similar to other datasets that are currently publicly available and frequently updated online, including: 1) weekly provisional counts of deaths from any cause by age for the United States and by state, starting in 2015 and updated through May 2020, 2) weekly provisional counts of deaths involving COVID-19 by race and hispanic origin for the United States and by state, updated weekly, and 3) weekly provisional counts of all deaths for the United States and by state, starting in 2019 and updated through May 2020.
