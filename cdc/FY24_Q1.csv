Thanks to the wonderful efforts of the CDC and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a major multinational public-private partnership in which the CDC plays a key role as a founding partner and organizer, we are on the brink of eradicating polio. Let me be clear: This outcome would have major implications for human health as polio stands to become only the second human disease to be eradicated. That’s nothing short of a mayor triumph for the United States in general (since polio vaccines were invented in two American universities in the 1950s)e CDC in particular (which has been and is heavily involved in this effort), and humanity as a whole. I have made several reasonable requests to the CDC media office for an interview, an emailed statement, or any kind of on-the-record comment about the CDC's role in polio eradication, our chances of succeeding, and what it means for the future. My requests have been met with short refusals, which is mind boggling since this is a I am seeking: 1) Copies of emails to and from the CDC media office in response to my requests sent in the first half of October 2023 (and one email sent on August). I want to understand how my requests were handled and ensure they were handled correctly in order to understand why they were not granted. Specifically, I want to understand why such a simple and reasonable request such as mine was not granted—especially as World Polio Day is coming up in less than two weeks and especially since the CDC issued a press release on September 21, 2023 marketing a MMWR article under the title “Progress Toward Poliomyelitis Eradication.” Issuing a press release to credentialed reporters (including myself, as I am on the CDC media list) is a clear invitation for media inquiries. The public has a right to know how their taxpayer dollars are spent on major public health initiatives as well as on the routine fulfilling of reasonable media requests. 2) I would also like to obtain copies of all relevant Media Office standard operating procedures for handling media requests. I want to understand specifically what criteria your press officers use to vet, grant, or deny media requests. Best, Jason Socrates Bardi"

I am writing to appeal the determination made in response to my Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, which was assigned Request #23-01864-FOIA. The initial response stated that my request did not qualify for expedited processing on the grounds that I ""failed to show that there is an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual."" I respectfully request that you reconsider this determination, as I believe it was improperly applied. I would like to bring to your attention that the determination made by your agency is not the sole determinant for expedition under both extant law and established case law. The criteria for expediting FOIA requests is explicitly defined by statutes, and the decision must be considered in the broader context of applicable legal standards and relevant case precedents. As stipulated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) Regulation, the requester must demonstrate two key factors to qualify for expedited processing: That the request involves a ""matter of widespread and exceptional media interest"" (28 C.F.R. § 16.5(e)(1)(iv)). That the matter is one ""in which there exists possible questions about the integrity of the government that affect public confidence"" (28 C.F.R. § 16.5(e)(1)(iv)). In support of my appeal, I wish to emphasize that my request meets both of these criteria. The matter at hand, which pertains to potential domestic influence by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), is unquestionably of widespread and exceptional media interest. It is widely recognized that matters related to foreign influence in domestic affairs have garnered significant public attention and media coverage. Furthermore, the context of my FOIA request aligns with the requirement that there exist ""possible questions about the integrity of the government that affect public confidence."" Courts, such as in the case of Edmonds v. FBI, have clarified that it is not necessary to demonstrate prejudice or an immediate exigency to the American public to qualify for expedited processing. Rather, the focus is on matters that raise legitimate questions about government integrity, particularly those that could impact public confidence in the government's ability to address these issues adequately, such as ability for the Biden administration to handle CCP influence domestically, grants to affiliated corporate structures, etc."

24-00319-FOIA,2023-12-11,"Webb, Major Mike",Major Mike Webb for VA,"The Western District of Missouri has recently enjoined the President, in part on the rationale that there was no science to support Dr. Fauci's claims that one-ply cotton was impervious to microbial penetration, a determination that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits. Review of agency action is limited to the grounds the agency relied upon when it took the action, and Dr. Cohen has recently recommended a return to masking because of a disease for which the WHO found no evidence to support that asymptomatic spread, or droplets expelled in coughing or sneezing, drove the outbreak in China for a Harvard Acceptance Rate Coronavirus, 12 times too low to validate the presence of a highly contagious disease, capable of setting off a superspreader event. It has required at least 100,000 particles--twice the infectious dose required to infect the most resistant human with anthrax, which even CDC doesn't dare to suggest is highly contagious--or 1,000 times the infectious dose for whooping cough, to infect everything from Syrian hamsters and transgenic mice to Rhesus monkeys and a highly contagious disease requires no more than 15 particles. An N95 is effective against tear gas for only an hour, and the smallest SARS-CoV-2 particle, above the virioli, is still six times smaller than the smallest configuration unit of CS gas, while in May 2021 CDC finally conceded that the primary means of transmission is by aerosols that can persist in the air for hours. In January 2021, John Lednicky determined that the smallest viriol for SARS-CoV-2 measures 0.25 microns, and an N95 filters 95% of particles 0.3 microns or larger. A simulated challenge study by NIOSH over a decade ago dispelled any myth regarding the impervious qualities of one-ply cotton for those who CDC suggested had thought, at the beginning of the pandemic, the virus was spread by droplets. The WHO revalidated that conclusion in June 2020, using observational studies, as even admitted four paragraphs below the Washington Post misleading headline. If the NIOSH in the Obama Administration had determined that substitutes might work, we would have no need for evolving science, unless you are one of those unscrupulous people who try to develop a car inspection your car might pass after you fail, which may occur at Don Beyer Volvo. So, we are requesting any and all documents to support the recent guidance from CDC to support their decision to recommend masking during the holiday season."
