Information helpful to fulfilling this request: In the clinical trial for Moderna’s pediatric COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), it found an increased rate of RSV and upper respiratory infections among children that received the vaccine. As provided in the FDA’s review memorandum for this vaccine: For 6 to 23-month-olds: “Within 28 days after vaccination, some respiratory tract-related infections were reported with greater frequency in the mRNA-1273 group compared to the placebo group, including croup, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and pneumonia. Events of croup were reported by 1.3% of mRNA-1273 recipients and 0.3% of placebo recipients, RSV by 0.8% of mRNA-1273 recipients and 0.5% of placebo recipients, and pneumonia by 0.2% of mRNA-1273 recipients and no placebo recipients.” For 2 to 5-year-olds: “Within 28 days after vaccination, some respiratory tract-related infections were reported with greater frequency in the mRNA-1273 group than in the placebo group. Events of pneumonia were reported by 0.3% and 0% of mRNA-1273 and placebo recipients, respectively. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection was reported by 0.4% and <0.1% of mRNA-1273 and placebo recipients, respectively.” For 6 to 11-year-olds: “Within 28 days after vaccination, some respiratory tract infection-related PTs were reported more frequently in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group, such as Respiratory syncytial virus infection (0.3% vs 0%) and Upper respiratory tract infection (3.9% vs 2.5%). An analysis including all respiratory-tract infection related PTs, except COVID-19, showed a small imbalance of 5.9% in the vaccine group compared to 4.4% in the placebo group.” In the clinical trial for Pfizer’s pediatric COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2), serious adverse events “reported in the BNT162b2 group included RSV bronchiolitis (5 participants), pneumonia (2 participants), gastroenteritis (2 participants), lower respiratory tract infection (2 participants).”"

This Hearing involved the sworn testimony of Anthony Fauci, MD, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Nancy Messonnier MD, Director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Our request centers on the question posed by Rep. Brett Gutherie (R-KY) at 53:05 of the House public hearing and the responses by Dr. Fauci. For clarity, the exchange is as follows: Rep. Brett Gutherie: “I want to look at some of the concerns. I’ve heard some parents claim that measles vaccine can cause brain inflammation, known as encephalitis. Is that true? Is that true?” Dr. Fauci: “Brain inflammation…encephalitis…” Rep. Guthrie: “Can measles vaccine cause encephalitis? The vaccine…” Dr. Fauci: “The vaccine? No. Rare.”"

As you may know, the CDC has run a data tracker site (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status) and made available the underlying data presented on that tracker, for an extended period during the current pandemic. Until recently, both the tracker and the available data set showed case and death rates by at up to four specific vaccination statuses, which included: unvaccinated; vaccinated with primary series only; vaccinated with booster; and vaccinated with 2nd booster. For obvious reasons, the last two categories were available only at later dates. As you can see, this data broke down the incidence of infection and death in the vaccinated category in up to 3 different categories, allowing the ability to assess the differences in effectiveness of different vaccination strategies. This data was also presented by MMWR week, and by age group and vaccine manufacturer, allowing comparisons of these different groups. With the roll out of the new bivalent booster, the data tracker, as well as the underlying downloadable dataset, have been changed. Now, all groups that have received any vaccine, but not the bivalent booster, are lumped together in one category. This makes it impossible to separately compare those who have received the bivalent booster to those who received only the primary vaccine, or one or two boosters on top of the primary regimen. These are important data for individuals to be aware of in making their personal decisions about the relative benefit of the bivalent booster for them. It is not clear to me why this change has been made in the data tracker, or the available data set. I am formally submitting this request under the Freedom of Information Act, then, to request the data regarding the number of infections and deaths, as well as population numbers, of the individual groups, as so: unvaccinated; vaccinated with primary series only; vaccinated with primary series and one booster; vaccinated with primary series and two boosters; vaccinated with any number of primary-series vaccines and bivalent booster. This data should be broken down by MMWR week, age group, and vaccine manufacturer. I will note that this request is for precisely the information that was formerly available for download from the CDC site, except now to include the same data for those who have also received the bivalent booster. In addition, I am also requesting copies of any internal communications at the CDC that relate to the decision to limit the availability of data about case and death rates by the various vaccine statuses, and instead lump all pre-bivalent-booster individuals into a single category.
