I hope this letter finds you well. My name is Sherrice Branch, and I am a sophomore at Siena College. As part of my academic pursuits, I am researching the discussions, studies, and decisions related to standardized testing between 2019 and 2023. Understanding the importance of transparency and accountability in educational policies, I am requesting internal reports, discussions, studies, and emails about standardized testing between the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Secretary of Education during the previously mentioned period. I believe that accessing this information will contribute significantly to my research, allowing me to gain valuable insights into the evolution of educational policies and practices during these years. Specifically, I am interested in understanding the perspectives, considerations, and outcomes that have shaped the approach to standardized testing from Pre-Covid-19 and Post-Covid-19. _x000D_
