Therefore, I believe this property could not have been developed without the Park’s express approval to connect to the Park's water and sewer system.  Clearly such approval by the park and the inherent approval of the actions directly connected to and dependent upon that approval constitutes a significant federal action requiring NEPA review including full public participation.
