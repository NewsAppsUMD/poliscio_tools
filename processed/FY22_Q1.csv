This sample must be taken directly from a human being, where the patient sample was not first combined with any other source of genetic material or contamination. 2) All records of scientific laboratory tests, under a microscope, analyzing and identifying the COVID-19 delta variant (SARS-CoV-2) virus from isolated samples extracted from a human being. This sample must be taken directly from a human being, where the patient sample was not first combined with any other source of genetic material or contamination. 3) All communication (electronic email, mail, phone call transcripts etc...) sent to Governor Charles D.

However, I agree in advance to pay up to $75 for the records request, and no approval is needed for fees less than $75. Granting a fee waiver would greatly benefit the community, as disclosure of these records is clearly in the public interest. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request.

Data that will back up the claim that ivermectin is ineffective and/or can have severe adverse results if prescribed (by a medical professional) for Covid-19. 2.) What has the CDC done to find a viable treatment option in place of ivermectin? Although the sentiment of “the vaccine is the best way to fight Covid-19” is highly touted, the fact is that even those who are vaccinated are dying of the virus and are going without treatment. 3.) Data on those who have died as a result of Covid-19 that went untreated, but who were vaccinated. 4.) Please provide information that states that patients do not have a right to treatment under CDC or other federal or state agencies related to or under the umbrella of the CDC. Why has the CDC taken away the rights of patients who are under the care of a medical professional and have informed consent? If a physical has a license as a medical professional to practice why do you not trust their judgement with their own patients? 5.) Why have warning letters been sent to pharmacies advising of loss of license for dispensing ivermectin in a way that may seem as though it is being used for Covid-19? If a licensed medical professional writes a prescription for a patient, why are the treatment options restricted? Please provide evidence/data that proves ivermectin that has been prescribed by a licensed medical professional has caused serious harm to patients. 7.)

The Request is made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552, 5 U.S.C. § 552 et seq., and CDC regulations. BACKGROUND The U.S. government maintains detention centers for migrants throughout the United States. Recognizing the extraordinary circumstances of COVID-19 and its major risk of spreading throughout institutionalized settings, the CDC issues guidance for detention centers for preventing and managing the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure the safety of detained individuals, staff, contractors, and visitors to detention centers. Previously, Biden administration officials created a plan to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to migrants held in the custody or control of the U.S. government. However, on November 8, 2021, the Washington Post revealed that Biden administration officials changed its position to implement a vaccination plan. As of the writing of this Request, the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. continue to grow with each new variant and there still is no uniform vaccination plan in place for detained migrants. However, as the administration’s own Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci confirmed, migrants are “absolutely not” driving the COVID-19 surge. To that end, Oxfam and RAICES seek disclosure of any and all responsive records, including all electronic documents and communications in the custody of CDC relating to this issue, as described in the specific requests and instructions below. REQUESTERS Oxfam America is a non-profit development agency dedicated to developing lasting solutions to poverty and social injustice. A centerpiece of this work involves supporting the world’s most vulnerable communities, including refugees and other forcibly displaced populations. Oxfam supports displaced communities by tackling the drivers of migration, providing emergency humanitarian aid to those fleeing persecution, and advocating that governments respect the human rights of migrants. RAICES, a non-profit legal services agency based in San Antonio, Texas, defends the rights of immigrants and refugees, empowers individuals, families, and communities, and advocates for their liberty and justice. With legal services, social programs, and an advocacy team focused on changing the narrative around immigration in this country, RAICES provides legal services and counsel in various immigrant detention facilities throughout the state of Texas and has continued to do so throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. DEFINITIONS Plan: The term “plan” as used in the Request relates to the COVID-19 vaccination program revealed in the Washington Post article. Records: The term “records” as used in the Request includes all records preserved in electronic or written form, including but not limited to: e-mails; text communications between phones or other electronic devices (including but not limited to, communications sent via SMS or other text, Blackberry Messenger, iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, G-chat, or Twitter direct message); images, video, and audio recorded on cell phones; voicemail messages; social-media posts; formal and informal presentations; alerts; bulletins; advisories; post-it notes, and agendas, minutes or notes of meetings and phone calls. Please note: Should any responsive record contain personally identifying information of any third party",Not Available,,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available
