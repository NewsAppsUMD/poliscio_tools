K-12 Library and classroom libraries have materials that are consistent with educational standards, with age-appropriate materials (defined below), and support student
achievement goals. Age appropriate means topics, messages, and teaching methods suitable to particular ages or age groups of children and adolescents, based on
developing cognitive, emotional, and behavioral capacity typical for the age or age group. Age-appropriate does not include any material with descriptions or visual depictions
of a sex act as defined in section 702.17.
Section 702.17 Sex act.
The term “sex act” or “sexual activity” means any sexual contact between two or more persons by any of the following:
1. Penetration of the penis into the vagina or anus.
2. Contact between the mouth and genitalia or mouth and anus or by contact between the genitalia of one person and the genitalia or anus of another person.
3. Contact between the finger, hand, or other body part of one person and the genitalia or anus of another person, except in the course of examination or treatment by a person licensed pursuant to chapter 148, 148C, 151, or 152.
4. Ejaculation onto the person of another.
5. By use of artificial sexual organs or substitutes therefore in contact with the genitalia or anus.
6. The touching of a person’s own genitals or anus with a finger, hand, or artificial sexual organ or other similar device at the direction of another person.
The following questions we've asked have gone unanswered.
- What resources and standards will the Department of Education apply to identify and classify the age-appropriateness of school library materials? When will teacher librarians and library workers be trained in these resources?
- Will classic literature that is part of the Advanced Placement curriculum for AP Literature and Composition now be illegal due to age-appropriateness? How will the College Board be made aware that Iowa’s Advanced Placement courses in Literature and Composition can no longer provide required classic literature due to the age-appropriateness definition?
- Will access to subscription-based school databases or ebook repositories be reviewed and potentially filtered to meet new state law requirements? If so, how so?
- What form of communication should teacher librarians anticipate if/when they are directed to remove books from the collection?

,,75,Department of Education,23-02881-F,Not Available,"Blobaum, David",-,Not Available,Other,"Hi, thank you for processing this request. Currently, colleges release some of their admissions information in their Common Data sets. However, almost all colleges are hiding information that is essential for students and parents to make informed decisions: how their SAT and ACT test-optional admissions policies actually impact their admissions processes. In 2021, a few colleges reported the breakdown of what percentage of their applicants submitted SAT/ACT scores for consideration and then what percentage of applicants were admitted with or without SAT/ACT scores. Today, none do so. This is vital information for students and parents to have. Without it, students and parents cannot make informed decisions. Worse, several recent studies have pointed out that colleges that look more at subjective criteria (essays, teacher recommendations, etc) give much greater preference to wealthy students. In order to evaluate if colleges are treating applicants fairly, students and parents need as much transparency as possible. Is it possible to get the following information from colleges? 1) Percentage of students who applied with and without submitting SAT or ACT scores, 2) Percentage of students who were admitting who did and did not submit SAT or ACT scores, 3) The demographic profile (race, family income, and zip codes) of those students that also lists if they submitted SAT or ACT scores and if they were admitted or not (the more classification data there is, such as if those students were legacies, recruited athletes, children of full-pay families, etc, the more we can help students and parents make informed decisions and also hold colleges accountable for providing the access and opportunity to students that they should be providing). Even just the above information on the top 200 colleges (because those are so highly selective) would be extremely helpful for families.",Not Available,2023-09-26,Request for Docs Sent,Not Available,-,-
