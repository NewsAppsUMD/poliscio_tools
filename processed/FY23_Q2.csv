A separate case report was then published by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science that month indicating that exported monkeys from that country have also had hard-to-detected melioidosis, a disease which is fatal to humans when untreated and one which has no readily available commercial test. Symptoms of the disease do not typically show up within the 31-day required U.S. quarantine period. With that in mind, it's a matter of public safety to know: how many non-human primate import shipments from Cambodia have occurred since November 17, 2022 and how many shipments are planned with filed paperwork or correspondence?

IIS distills vaccination for individuals at the population level for surveillance and program evaluation. When I inquired about the availability of IIS data aggregated at the county level, Ms. Kingerly told me that the Freedom of Information Act unit provided information about proposals and contractual agreements required for academic analysis with these data. We want to evaluate associations between HPV vaccination and community-level measures of social determinants of health. The PLACES (CDC) and County Health Rankings and Roadmaps (RWJF) projects are examples of county-level data that could uncover predictors of vaccination adherence when merged with county-level IIS files. I would appreciate your agency's advice about the feasibility of applying for a restricted data set for analysis purposes using a data use agreement between my university and the CDC. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to your response.",Not Available,2023-01-17,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available

The Safer Federal Workforce Task Force (the Task Force) subsequently made COVID-19 testing of unvaccinated and undeclared employees a requirement for staff to work on federal facilities. Please provide a copy of the determination that testing of unvaccinated, and undeclared employees should be a “considered” or a requirement. Please see the quotation below from Interim Guidance for SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Non Healthcare Workplaces (last visited 14 February 2023), updated Oct. 5, 2021. When to consider screening testing Screening testing in non-healthcare settings of unvaccinated workers without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may be useful to detect COVID-19 early and stop transmission quickly, particularly in areas with community COVID-19 indicators in the moderate to high categories (Table 2, Table 3). Additionally, please provide citations for the peer reviewed or similar Journal articles or published research supporting CDC decision to “consider” or required COVID-19 testing of unvaccinated and undeclared employees.
