We are collecting data from several sources to understand how the prevalence and reporting of sexual misconduct has changed over time. The goal of this research is to publish the results in scientific journals and through these publications inform the public debate about the determinants of sexual violence as well as the reporting of such violence. We have looked at the NEISS-AIP data on the CDC website (through WISQARS) and found it very interesting. However, for the purposes of our research we would need to get more detailed data on injuries than the data available through WISQARS. We would ideally like to access the microdata. This data is available until 2014 on (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/series/198). We would need this type of data for 2017 and ideally also for 2016 and 2015. If you can provide this type of micro data for these last 3 years we do not need anything further. However, if you cannot provide the microdata we request that that you provide the data on a month-by-month basis instead of a year-by-year basis in which it is currently provided through WISQARS. Specifically, we would need the number of sexual assaults recorded each month as well as the number of other types of assaults (the “Assault – Other” category in WISQARS). We will use the other types of assaults as a comparison group for the sexual assaults. I have attached an example of what such a data set could look like using the output from WISQARS as a template. However, please feel free to provide the data in the format that is the simplest for you. Note that we only need the actual records data, not the estimates for the population or the statistical details (such as CV or confidence intervals), this should make it easier to extract this data from the raw data. Ideally, we would like the data to go back to 2010 until the latest month available. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns regarding our request. We would be more than happy to respond to any question either by email or in a phone meeting.
