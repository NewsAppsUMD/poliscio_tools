(NPR) that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention make available to me for inspection and copying all records of 57.305 forms (Hemovigilance Module Incident) that are required to be reported and submitted through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) from the state of Massachusetts. Please send all records created January 1, 2014 through the present (till the receipt of this request). If the Patient ID# and Facility ID# can be traced back to the patient and the facility respectively, that information can be redacted before releasing these forms. As you know, the FOIA provides that if portions of a document are exempt from release, the remainder must be segregated and disclosed. Therefore, please send me all non-exempt portions of the records I have requested and justify any deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the FOIA. I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any materials. Since some of the documents listed above may be more readily available than others, please provide the documents that are available as soon as possible without waiting to provide access to all the documents. The FOIA provides for waiver or reduction of fees if disclosure could be considered as “primarily benefiting the general public.” I am a journalist employed by NPR and intend to use the information I am requesting as a basis for a planned news story, which makes me a “representative of the news media.” Therefore, I ask that you waive all duplication fees. If you deny this request, however, and the fees will exceed $25, please notify me of the charges before you fulfill my request so that I may decide whether to pay the fees or appeal your denial of my request for a waiver. I submit this request in my capacity as a journalist, and this information is time-sensitive. Accordingly, I would appreciate your communicating with me by telephone or email at 609-251-7348 or tchristopher@npr.org, rather than by mail, if you have any questions regarding this request. You can also communicate with anyone in NPR’s Legal Department, including Rachel Seller (rseller@npr.org) or Micah Ratner (mratner@npr.org).
