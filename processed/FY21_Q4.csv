(2) The virus must be visualized under a microscope, a photo taken, and be characterized as a unique biochemical structure. You must sequence its genome and determine which proteins it is made of. (3) The purified virus must be transferred into an experimental host and cause disease. If these steps are not followed, this proves that COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) does not exist.

SARS-CoV Patent Exists: https://patents.google.com/patent/US7220852B1/en , but we can’t seem to find the patent for SARS-CoV-2, or any data on it being isolated. Also: Isn’t it AGAISNT THE LAW to patent a virus? Its nature if found in nature and a biological weapon if made synthetically. Which are both illegal to patent. Also, strange how the patent blocks any researcher or scientist from looking to close at the data pertaining to SARS-CoV. If the answer is no, you don’t have any information matching our inquiry in the way we stated it on SARS-CoV-2 being isolated, how is it that your health officials are telling the world that it exists? Also, how would a PCR TEST be “positive” for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) if it hasn’t even been isolated (confirmed to exist)? I would be legitimately confused. If the answer is no, you don’t have any information matching our inquiry in the way we stated it on SARS-CoV-2 being isolated, can you please provide the original documentation and records, of the FIRST SARS-CoV-2 Human infection in America. Also, All Records on the processes used to classify SARS-CoV-2 as a VIRUS that your agency has or has had. If you regard any of the requested records as subject to exemption from required disclosure under the law, I hereby request that you exercise your discretion and disclose them, nonetheless. If you decide to withhold any requested records, please do not deny the entire request and release information available under law. If you cannot fulfill certain parts of this request or certain portions claimed to be exempt, explain in writing the justification for redacting the record, indicate the extent of any redactions on the portion of the record which is made available or published and where technically feasible indicate on the redacted portion itself the specific exception(s) claimed. I make the request on behalf of my family, friends, and community, in which we all communicate often about certain issues in our area. The records disclosed will be shared and used around this community and made public. Accordingly, I request that you waive all fees in the public interest because the furnishings of information sought by this request will primarily benefit the public and is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government. If, however, you decline to waive all fees, I am prepared to pay any associated fees, just please notify me.",Not Available,2021-08-07,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available

Isolation/purification meaning that the virus was separated from everything else.
