The solicitor for the Rocky Mountain region, in an August 1982 opinion, determined that although NPS had no authority to administer the right-of-way or enforce traffic laws, it did have ""the responsibility for the usual maintenance actions such as repaving, filling potholes, striping, and even reconstruction of the road."" The solicitor's report concluded that a satisfactory division of maintenance responsibilities could only be worked out between NPS and the Forest Service. ""Unfortunately, it appears likely that the present situation will continue for some time,"" the solicitor wrote.  https://highways.dot.gov/public-roads/julyaugust-2006/orphaned-highway#:~:text=Even%20though%20the%20Beartooth%20carries,nickname%20the%20%22orphaned%20highway.%22",Not Available,10/5/2022,Closed,Full Grant,10/18/2022,Not Available
