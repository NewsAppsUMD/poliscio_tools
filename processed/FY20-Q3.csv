If you look at San Francisco from 2000 and review data compared to other counties, the data is analytically incorrect. Also the symptoms given by public health surveillance were not aligned with real symptoms for specific illnesses and injuries. Another concern is that HHS was giving fake symptoms as in the freakish mystery illness in San Jose and surrounding areas (which was to get people tested and placed on surveillance): https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mercurynews.com/2012/01/25/cdc-study-of-freakish-mystery-illness-finds-no-cause/amp/ This was HHS and SAMHSA, which HHS asked for money from Congress to have CDC investigate. These symptoms are created through public health electronic surveillance by HHS, US Public Health and the CDC. 3) In June 2015 HHS (Koppaka and possibly others at the Office of National Security at HHS) placed surveillance on me 24 hours a day, 7 days a week which involves constant programs, rhetoric, PsyOps, etc which make it nearly impossible to function. Through all this, I took Koppaka to Federal court in which Koppaka and others used surveillance on the US Attorney, the Judge and the 9th Citcuit Court illegally you influence a favorable ruling. It is my belief that this was happening not only in Region 9 but other areas for politics to get people to move (reverse gerrymandering), for votes, for violent protest like January 6, 2021. Under surveillance, you are continually fed rhetoric and neuro-rhetoric which can be reinforced with please/pain symptoms l. I’m requesting all notes, investigations, details, communication through normal electronic communication plus that of public health surveillance in which rhetoric, neuro-rhetoric and Think Aloud software since June 2015 to current day. It is also concerning that Koppaka potentially is using CDC equipment illegally to continue harassment, isolation and violating my Bill of Rights which clearly are stated in Article one, section 8. My past major concern is that I have documentation from the CDC stating I’m on their ‘blacklist’ which is clearly unconstitutional under the Constitution. I’m will to share with CDC Senior Officials. It is very concerning that Koppaka also stated various times to his US Attorney that he knew nothing about Public Health Surveillance and how",Not Available,2021-02-13,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available,Not Available

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20071-7403 2 March 2021 CDC/ATSDR Attn: FOIA Office, MS-D54 1600 Clifton Road, N.E. Atlanta, GA 30333 Via email: FOIARequests@cdc.gov Re: EXPEDITED Freedom of Information Act Request for Immunization Data Lake Dear Information Officer: Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), I hereby request the following: • An electronic copy of all records and all releasable data fields in the patient-level Immunization Data Lake deidentified COVID-19 vaccination data from 10 December 2020 to 10 March 2021 similar to the data provided under my December 2020 FOIA #21-00362-FOIA with changes as follows: • This FOIA request includes the recipient_address_state as well as the administration_address_state because rates of vaccination population cannot be calculated without the residence state. The state value does not identify anyone any more than the administration value does. • This FOIA request includes vaccines distributed by the federal entities. The previous data had an awardee (meta_ext_entity) for every vaccine but did not have any records from any of the federal entities, nor was there any redaction explained for those records. • This FOIA request includes an electronic copy of the user manual, data dictionary and lookup codes for any coded values in the data, including the cvx, administration-location and meta_ext_entity. Since the agency has already released this data once it should be able to release this immediately. If any part of this is ready sooner than other parts (such as the data view parquet extract or documentation) please release that immediately rather than waiting for the other parts. I am a representative of the Washington Post, a news media organization primarily engaged in the dissemination of information that is urgently needed to inform the public of actual or alleged Federal Government activity. This request qualifies for expedited processing because: 1) knowledge of vaccination distribution is a matter of current exigency to the American public; 2) delay in releasing information about vaccine distribution will compromise the recognized public interest in being informed about the ongoing public debate over equity in vaccine distribution; 3) Tracking vaccine distribution is clearly federal government activity, and 4) there are credible claims, including by disadvantaged groups and members of Congress, that aspects of the government’s activity in vaccine distribution is improper. I certify that this information is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. (See Al-Fayed v. C.I.A., 254 F.3d 300, 310 (D.C. Cir. 2001); Bloomberg, L.P. v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 500 F.Supp.2d 371, 378 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). If you regard these documents as potentially exempt from the FOIA’s disclosure requirements, I request that you nonetheless exercise your discretion to disclose them. As the FOIA requires under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(8), please release all segregable, non-exempt portions of documents. To permit me to reach an intelligent and informed decision whether to file an administrative appeal of any denied material, please describe any withheld records (or portions thereof) and explain the basis for your exemption claims. As required by the statute, please review whether there is any foreseeable harm from disclosing the requested records, or if any potential harm would be limited in comparison to the public interest in disclosure. As required by 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(8), please release all such information, even if it technically may fall under a FOIA exemption. As a representative of the news media, The Washington Post qualifies for news media fee status under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II) and, therefore, may not be charged search and review fees.
