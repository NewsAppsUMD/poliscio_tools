Per NIOSH Interim Report 4, attached as Exhibit A, the Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) conducted Personal Breathing Zone (PBZ) air sampling for benzene and other Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) using passive Organic Vapor Monitors (OVMs) and charcoal tubes that were submitted for laboratory analyses. Charcoal OVM badges were placed on personnel identified as having the highest potential for exposure and charcoal tubes also were used to determine airborne concentrations of contaminants. The NIOSH HHE study findings were released in a series of nine interim reports as well as a final report published August 2011, attached as Exhibit B. The NIOSH DHOS HHE mostly reported that contaminants were below Occupational Exposure Limits (OEL) or not detected in air monitoring and PBZ assessments. This includes onshore and offshore airborne contaminants for VOCs and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well as monitoring of chemicals of concern in COREXIT dispersants. In addition, dermal exposure risks were calculated primarily through observational methods.

Does the number displayed reflect the TOTAL number of post-vaccination deaths recorded in VAERS for the specified date range…or only a subset of the total? 2. What criteria constitutes a post-vaccination death? Is it simply that the patient died at some point after being vaccinated…or are there other conditions to consider? 3. What criteria is currently used to calculate post-vaccination deaths published on the website? 4. Which fields from the VAERS data is used in the current calculation? 5. VAERS database appears to record deaths in more than one field. Who made the decision as to which field(s) to use for calculating the published deaths and what was the reason(s) behind it? 6. Has the calculation or data fields used in the calculation for the published post-vaccination deaths ever changed over time, and if so, for all instances: a. When was it done? b. Exactly what was changed in the calculation? c. Who authorized it? d. What was reason for the change? This request stems from the fact that some 3rd-party websites which claim to use the VAERS data are reporting 24,827 total deaths post-vaccination. After querying the VAERS data myself, I can see that the 12K figure is based on the patient having a Symptom of 'death', while the 24K figure is based on the patient having an Event of 'death'. Furthermore, the dataset for the 24K figure has the Date of Death populated...so surely that must be the correct figure, and the CDC is under-reporting??
